# Symbolic-Regression
# Symbolic Regressions searches different mathematical expressions in order to best fit a set of data
# To do this, a binary tree with a depth of 9 was used to store all parts of the expression
# The following operators were used: +, -, *, /, sin, cos, x (variable)
# Expressions were saved as strings (for evaluation) and arrays (to allow swapping tree branches between individuals for GA)
